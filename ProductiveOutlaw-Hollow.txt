Productive Outlaws - Hollow
(Graduate Project)

CGM - 20/20
	There's a lot of cool stuff here.
	Typical platforming, with a wall-climbing system 
	that complements movement well.
	Combat's there, in a few different forms.
	Character switching works, and the AI for the other character
	is decently implemented.
	
	One recommendation I have: both saber and archer are controlled
	with the same scheme. If you used an external controller object
	& just told it which character to feed instructions to, you
	could severely reduce the amount of code needed in each character.
	(also, with the proper setup most of their behavior can be abstracted to a base object)
	
Documentation - 10/10

Sprites - 10/10
	Significant actors are all animated appropriately

Artwork - 10/10
	Artwork is harmonious, with minimal clashing between elements.
	Actors, props & environment are all visually distinguishable.

Rooms/Level Design - 10/10
	Level design largely features two paths - one high, one low.
	Due to the nature of the AI, they'll usually end up on the lower path.
	Sticking to the top path allows you to deal with archers, while
	allowing the AI character to demonstrate their own prowess.
	The topology of the landscape seems to be designed with the 
	wall-climbing ability in mind, as it's very easy to flow freely across it,
	which allows the player to free up their concentration and focus on combat.

Music/Sound effects - 5/10
	Music is present, but no sounds.

Objects - 3/5
	The point of parents & inheritence is to avoid having to repeat shared behavior.
	Having base objects for players & enemies 
	doesn't accomplish anything if there's no defined base behavior.

Paths - 5/5
Challenge - 3/5
	In my experience, the damage inflicted by enemies was offset from
	the healing delivered by regularly leveling up.
	In addition, with the very high movement speed it's very easy to
	run through the crowds without engaging in combat.
